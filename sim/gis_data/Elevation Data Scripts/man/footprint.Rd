\title{Human footprint}

\description{
The "human footprint" is an estimate of the direct and indirect human pressures on the environment. The human pressure is measured using eight variables including built-up environments, population density, electric power infrastructure, crop lands, pasture lands, roads, railways, and navigable waterways. It is expressed on a scale of 0 (low) to 50 (high footprint). 

See https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201667 for the details. 

The original data are available here: 

https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/wildareas-v3
 
Data are available for two years: 1993 and 2009, for all terrestrial areas except Antarctica. The footprint of seas and oceans was set to zero. The original data was in the Mollweide projection at a 1000 m spatial resolution. The data available through this function was transformed to a longitude/latitude grid at 30-seconds resolution.

Users are free to use, copy, distribute, transmit, and adapt the work for commercial and non-commercial purposes, without restriction, as long as clear attribution of the source is provided.
